Lipman's Artificial Intelligence Directory

This repository gathers a personal collection of many algorithms. Some of these algorithms were enterily developed by me, while others not.

All the Source Code that you can find in this repository aims to help those interested in Artificial Intelligence. Each code is explained in its corresponding post written in my personal blog (http://laid.delanover.com). Here you can find a list of all posts classified by field of interest: http://laid.delanover.com/post-index/

You can do whatever you want with the code. It is 100% up to you, and there is no warranties of any kind. 

If you want to tell me something about any code (improvement, bug, error, misunderstandings, ...) please do it.

Finally, you can find me on Twitter: @jmlipman
